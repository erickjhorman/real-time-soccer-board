**How to push changes**

We're working with GIT flow base development
1. Create a branch like this feature/<name of your branch> from develop and make pushes to it directly 
2. Create a pull request from your branch to develop to add changes to the repo
3. Create a pull request from develop to release if you need to pass changes from develop to release.


Branch strategy
Rebase the remote branch to have a clear commit historic

1. Create a branch from develop and make pushes to it directly 
2. Create a pull request from your branch to develop to add changes to the repo
3. Create a pull request from develop to release if you need to pass changes from develop to release.
